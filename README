This project is to create a tool for detecting code smells in scala. This is a code-quality tool for scala. The project in its bare-bones provides a framework to create a full-fledged smell detection tool for scala.

It is still in the initial stages and works on simple scala code (code that does not use sbt). It currently works on itself and on the sample code in Example.scala.

Currently the following smells are implemented
Explicit-Return :  using the word "return" to return from a method is considered a smell
Using-Null : any use of null is a smell
Redundant-returnType: specifying the return-type of the method when the return-type can be inferred is considered a smell

Many other smells can be added in a similar way.

To compile use 
ant compile

To run use
ant run-on-scout
ant run-example

For code-coverage report
ant undercover-report
